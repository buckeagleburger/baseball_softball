			<p>This is our sales page. We're going to list the items that we currently 
			use. But, you're most definitely not limited to just these options. When 
			buying equipment or apparel you want to in into consider your position 
			(glove), your size (pants), what brand of shoes is comfortable to you 
			(cleats), and your strength and height (bat). There are countless numbers of
			websites and stores you can go to to look at equipment or apparel to be
			prepared for a game, practice, or just having fun. Some popular places like
			Scheels, Dick's Sporting Goods, or even just the actual brand website like
			Rawlings or Marucci. Or, there is also fan gear you can buy for your favorite
			team whether it's a major league team or college.</p>

			<p>Baseball is one of the more expensive sports to play so it is very important to find gear that you like and gear that performs well for you so you don't have to buy anything extra. The type of bat or glove you use actually makes a difference so purchasing the correct bat and glove is vital.</p>
