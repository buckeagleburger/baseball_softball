				When comparing pitching between baseball and softball the first noticeable
				thing is how the windups are significantly different. In baseball it's an
				overhand throw to pitch and they are sixty feet away from home plate. But, in
				softball they pitch an underhand throw and are pitching from forty three
				feet away. Although people think baseball is harder from the looks at it
				with the distance of everything because it's so much longer/bigger, there
				is a lot of different aspects that go into it.
				</div>
				<div class="mycolor col-12 col-md-6">
				Although baseball pitchers reach a higher velocity, with softball being 
				a shorter distance the speeds and reaction times are very comparable. Another
				difference between the two sports is that baseball players are pitching off
				of an elevated mound as opposed to softball players from even ground in a
				circle. The main pitches thrown in softball consist on a fastball,
				changeup, curveball, and a rise and drop ball. In baseball the most common
				pitches are a four seam fastball, a two seam fastball, a curveball, a
				slider, and a changeup.
				</div>
				<div class="mycolor col-12 col-md-6">
				Another big impact in the difference between pitching in baseball or
				softball is the size of the ball. Baseballs are white with red seams and
				softball are yellow with red seams. The size of a baseball is nine inches (in
				circumference) and a a softball is ten inches (in circumference). With the
				baseball being smaller it's easier to hold onto and this makes it easier
				with different grips allowing them to have many types of pitches to throw
				compared to softball. But pitches like the drop and rise ball in softball
				are movements baseball players don't see.
